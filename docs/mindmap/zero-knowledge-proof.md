## [Definition](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf)

- Proof without revealing any info

## Why ZK-Proof

- Privacy
- Security
- Identity Verification

## Participants

- Prover
- Verifier

## [ZK-Proof Protocol Properties](https://101blockchains.com/zero-knowledge-proof/)

- Completeness
- Soundness
- Zero-Knowledge

## Proccess

- Witness
